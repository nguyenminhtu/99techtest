1. Line 1-3: WalletBalance interface missing blockchain property but line 38 and 46-47 try to access balance.blockchain, TS will throw compilation error. Need to add blockchain: string to the interface.

2. Line 19: getPriority parameter typed as blockchain: any instead of proper string type. Should use union types for supported blockchains.

3. Line 39: use lhsPriority without declaration, it will crash the app with ReferenceError. Should be balancePriority instead.

4. Line 40-42: Filter logic is backwards - keeps balances with amount <= 0 which makes no sense for a wallet display. Should filter out zero/negative balances and do not keep them.

5. Line 36-54: getPriority function is used inside useMemo but not included in dependency array at line 54, this can cause stale closure bugs and incorrect memoization.

6. Line 45-53: Sort function incomplete - doesn't handle case when priorities are equal, will give inconsistent ordering. Missing return statement for equal case.

7. Line 56-61: formattedBalances is declared but never actually used anywhere, just wasted computation on every render. Either use it in rows mapping or remove it.

8. Line 63: Type mismatch in rows mapping - sortedBalances is WalletBalance[] but mapped as FormattedWalletBalance, missing the formatted property will cause runtime errors.

9. Line 67: classes.row is being used but classes never defined/imported, will either crash or styles won't work. Need to import or define the classes object.

10. Line 68: use array index as React key prop is an anti-pattern, causes poor reconciliation performance and potential rendering bugs. should use unique identifier like balance.currency instead.

11. Line 71: balance.formatted value doesn't exist because we're mapping over sortedBalances (WalletBalance[]) not formattedBalances, will cause runtime error.

12. Line 56-61: formattedBalances is recalculated on every render without memoization. should use useMemo for expensive operations like that.

13. Line 11-13: empty Props interface extending BoxProps is pointless

14. Line 19-34: this function will be re-creates on every render

15. Line 15: children destructured but never used

16. No loading states or empty data handling
